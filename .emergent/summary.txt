<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested the creation of a Sentient Tracker application.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **Core Functionality**: A tool to track sentiment for games by analyzing Reddit posts.
- **AI Model**: Use a budget-friendly model like GPT-4o-mini for analysis.
- **Data Source**: Must use public Reddit endpoints, without requiring users to sign up for Reddit API keys. The final implementation uses the Arctic Shift public data archive.
- **UI/UX**: A dark, cyberpunk-themed user interface.
- **User Management**: The application must be account-based. Users should be able to sign up and log in to manage their own list of tracked games.
- **Authentication**: Support for both Email/Password and Google OAuth sign-in.
- **Game Management**: Users must have the ability to add, view, delete, and **edit** their tracked games.
- **Analysis Output**: For each scan, the AI should produce a sentiment label (Positive/Mixed/Negative), a summary, top themes, pain points, and wins.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack MVP application has been developed. The backend is built with FastAPI and uses MongoDB (via Beanie ODM) for data storage. The frontend is a React single-page application styled with TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI components, featuring the requested dark cyberpunk theme. User authentication (Email/Password and Google OAuth) is fully implemented, allowing users to manage their own private lists of tracked games. The application fetches Reddit data using the Arctic Shift public API, analyzes it with GPT-4o-mini, and displays detailed sentiment analysis results, including source posts.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing and testing the complete user authentication system (Google and Email/Password) and adding the functionality for users to edit their tracked games.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues. All requested features have been implemented and tested by the agent.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Task (P1):** Improve data source reliability. The current dependency on the Arctic Shift public API is a potential point of failure. Future work could involve building a more robust data provider abstraction layer to easily swap sources or integrating a more stable, authenticated API.
- **Future Task (P2):** Enhance user management features, such as implementing a Forgot Password flow for email-based accounts.
- **Future Task (P2):** Improve security by revisiting the use of  cookies for session management instead of . The agent reverted to  due to implementation complexities, but cookies offer better protection against XSS attacks.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-stack Application Development**: Built the Sentient Tracker MVP from the ground up.
- **Backend Implementation (FastAPI)**:
    - Set up API endpoints for user authentication, game CRUD, and sentiment scanning.
    - Integrated MongoDB with Beanie ODM for , , and  models.
- **Frontend Implementation (React)**:
    - Developed a multi-page UI for login, dashboard, and game details.
    - Implemented the dark cyberpunk theme using TailwindCSS and Shadcn.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**:
    - Resolved multiple data source blockages, iterating from Reddit's public JSON, to Pushshift, PullPush, and finally implementing a working solution with the **Arctic Shift API**.
    - Implemented caching, throttling, and a detailed debug panel for data fetching.
- **AI Integration**: Integrated  to use GPT-4o-mini for sentiment analysis.
- **User Authentication**:
    - Implemented a complete authentication system with Email/Password and Google OAuth.
    - Secured endpoints and associated data (games, scans) with individual user accounts.
- **Feature Implementation**: Added the ability for users to **edit** their existing tracked games.
- **Documentation**: Created  and  files.
- **Testing**: Performed successful end-to-end manual and automated testing.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All issues that arose during the session, primarily related to data source availability and frontend auth state, were resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None. This is the first session.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11, MongoDB, Beanie (Asynchronous ODM), JWT Authentication.
- **Frontend**: React 18, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, React Router, Axios, Context API.
- **AI**: Sentiment analysis and summarization via  (GPT-4o-mini).
- **Data Source**: Arctic Shift API (a public Reddit data mirror).
- **Architecture**: Microservices-style architecture containerized with Docker and orchestrated with .

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: 
-   **games**: 
-   **scan_results**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- The Reddit data source was changed multiple times due to external service availability, moving from Reddit's native JSON -> Pushshift -> PullPush -> **Arctic Shift**.

**All files of reference**
- ****: Contains the core FastAPI application logic and API routes.
- ****: Manages all user authentication logic for both email and Google.
- ****: Implements the data fetching from the Arctic Shift API. **This is a critical file if the data source fails.**
- ****: Defines the application's routing structure.
- ****: Manages global authentication state (user, token, loading).
- ****: The main page for running scans and viewing results.
- ****: Defines how to build and run the backend, frontend, and database services.
- ****: The Product Requirements Document outlining the project goals.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The data ingestion logic in  is tightly coupled to the Arctic Shift API. This could be refactored into a more abstract provider pattern to make it easier to switch data sources in the future.
- The session token is stored in  on the frontend. For improved security, the implementation could be refactored to use  cookies, which the agent initially attempted but abandoned due to complexity.

-   **Games**: , , , , 
-   **Scans**: , 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Data Source Fragility**: The application's core functionality depends on the **Arctic Shift API**, a free, public service with no SLA. If scans start failing, the first place to check is this service's status and the logic in .
- **Authentication Flow**: User authentication relies on JWTs stored in . All protected API requests from the frontend must include the  header. The  hook and  are central to managing the user session on the frontend.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **Request**: Okay now make this account based, eg sign up to use this platform so each user has their own search’s. Use friendly sign up options like Google or email etc. Also the ability to edit games for the scans - **Status**: Completed.
2.  **Input**: 3 (selecting an implementation option) - **Status**: Handled.
3.  **Request**: Update the app to remove any requirement for Reddit API signup/keys. - **Status**: Completed.
4.  **Request**: Fix the Reddit JSON parsing and error handling for scans. - **Status**: Completed.
5.  **Request**: Reddit is returning HTTP 403 when fetched from the server... Update the app to use Pushshift... - **Status**: Completed (though Pushshift also failed and was replaced).

The remaining messages were AI-generated or implicit confirmations. All explicit user requests have been addressed.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: None.
- **Mocked**: None. The app relies on a live third-party service (Arctic Shift), which is a dependency risk but not a mock.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Used for AI summarization via . Uses Emergent LLM Key.
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: For user authentication. Requires user-provided API keys.
- **Arctic Shift**: Public, key-less API for fetching Reddit data archives.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
